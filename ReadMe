This is a sample application project highlighting the microservice architecture developed in scala using play.
Asynchronous calls have been demonstrated using akka's actor system and by usage of futures.
Cassandra datbase have been used in order to make the rest services complete end to end and meaningful and connection is provided.
This can be changed according to one's db requirements.
Example REST endpoints have been created on simple resource "employee" by GET, POST and DELETE for demonstration.
Scalatestplus have been used to generate sample test cases for few scenarios.
All dependencies are added and should be automatically downloaded/ resolved on importing the project.

The intention is to provide a small working project to begin with a system/micro-service,
without having to go through the process of setting up all the environment, struggling with version selection and corresponding dependencies.
It is also useful for learning the play-scala-akka working in non blocking way for beginners.
Also it saves the efforts by providing the already set up project with all basic things required.
Therefore the efforts can directly be applied on business logic and client requirements.
